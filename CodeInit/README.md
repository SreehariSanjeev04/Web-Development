This is the website that was created for Code.Init() hackathon held at NITC.
Our team consisted of Sreehari, Adithya and Anirudh.
This is a simple alumni website created on HTML, CSS and Javascript, where yearbook and milestones of former students can be viewed.
The website also contains a login system (only for admins) where the admin can add yearbooks to the existing ones. The information is stored in localstorage.
